- The webpack plugin ecosystem is diverse, and there are a lot of plugins that can 
  help specifically with development:
  
    - case-sensitive-paths-webpack-plugin
        - can be handy when you are developing on case-insensitive environment like
          macOS or Windows but using case-sensitive environment like Linux for production
    - npm-install-webpack-plugin 
        - allows webpack to install and wire the installed packages with your package.json
          as you import new packages to your project.
    - react-dev-utils
        - contains webpack utilities developed for Create React App. Despite its name, 
          they can find use beyond React. If you want only webpack message formatting,
          consider webpack-format-messages.
    - start-server-webpack-plugin
        - is able to start your server after webpack build completes.
