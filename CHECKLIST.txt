All the concepts and techniques are based on https://survivejs.com/webpack/, and webpack
official documentation. This repo uses Webpack v.4 and above.

File Structure:
    For now, the webpack folders consist of three sub folders:
        - Common, for shareable components regardless of environment
        - Development, for development specific components
        - Production, for production specific components

Current capabilities:
    - HTML:
        - Able to generate favicons for different browsers (webpack/common/webpack.favicons.js)
        - Able to generate HTML dynamically (webpack/common/webpack.html-webpack.js)
    - Development:
        - Notifications :
            - Able to notify user by utilizing windows/mac notification to indicate build status. (webpack/common/notifications/webpack.notifier.js)
            - Able to notify user by ringing the OS sounds to make error more noticeable (webpack/common/notifications/webpack.system-bell.js)
        - Error Overlay :
            - Error to be shown on browser (webpack/common/webpack.error-overlay)

    - Webpack Development Server (WDS)
        - WDS works with the capabilities to initiate hard refresh on changes detected.
          Of course, there is HMR (Hot Module Replacement) to show changes without hard refresh.
          WDS utilize watch mode by default. WDS also allows to host file in memory.
          (webpack/development/webpack.devServer.js)
