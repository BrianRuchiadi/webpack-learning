Sean Larkin Mastering Webpack From The Inside Out : Everything is the Plugin

- What is Tapable?
    - 200 line plugin library
    - The backbone of the plugin system
    - Tapable Instance (Something you can plug into)
        - A class / object that extends Tapable

    - Compiler / Central Engine 
        - Exposed via Node API
        - Central Dispatch
        - Start / Stop

    - Compilation / The Dependency Graph (The Brain)
        - Created by the Compiler
        - Contains Dependency Graph Traversal Algorithm

    - The Resolver / The bloodhound
        - Finding the files

    - The Module Factory
        - Takes successfully resolved requests
        - Collects source for that file. Create a module object

    - Parser / Abstract Syntax Trees
        - Parses
        - Takes a module Object and turns into AST to parse
        - Find all require ? imports, create DEPENDENCY'S

        - so now, inside module object, we have dependencies.
    
    * If it is not JavaScript, loaders gonna change it to JavaScript
    
    - Template
        - Data binding for your modules
        - Creates the code you actually see in output bundle
